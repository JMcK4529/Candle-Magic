# Candle-Magic

## Project Description
This short script creates a window wherein several images are displayed and can be scrolled through with the use of a single button.

## How to Install Candle-Magic
1. Ensure you have a Python IDE and have the following libraries installed:
      - tkinter
      - pillow (PIL)
2. Download "Black_Screen.jpg", "Unlit_Candle.jpg", "Burning_Candle.jpg" and the "Candle Magic.py" script.
3. Before running the script, check that these are all saved in the same folder/location.

## How to Use Candle-Magic
1. Click the button and follow any written instructions.
2. Once the candle appears lit, you will be unable to make changes while it "naturally" burns out.  
This will take a random amount of time, up to 10 seconds.
